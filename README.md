# Harden-Runner â€“ Testing Detections
 
Harden-Runner is a purpose-built network filtering and runtime security monitoring platform for CI/CD runners. It helps prevent exfiltration of credentials, detects tampering of source code during builds, and spots compromised dependencies and build tools through network, process and file write monitoring.  

Harden-Runner has several different detection types: 

* Secrets in Build Logs 
* Secrets in Artifacts 
* Outbound Calls Blocked 
* Anomalous Outbound Network Calls 
* Suspicious Outbound Network Calls 
* Source Code Overwritten 
* HTTPS Outbound Network Calls 
* Action Uses Imposter Commit 
* Suspicious Process Events (Reverse Shell, Priviledged Container, Runner Memory Read)
